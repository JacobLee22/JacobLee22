- 👋 Hi, I’m @JacobLee22
- 👀 this is my second year taking a computer science course as last year I took AP Computer Science and Principles
- 🌱 I’m currently taking this course to improve compute science skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with friends and be able to create something together.
- 📫 The goal that I have for this class that I want to accomplish is to be more fluent with computer science, specifically, coding.
